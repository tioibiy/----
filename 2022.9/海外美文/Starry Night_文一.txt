starry night
Staring at the window, seeing nothing but the black night.
The soul was burning, in a blue, faint light.
Asking to the world-why Iâ€™m still alive?
Ravens, answering nothing and passing by;
Rimes covering the trembling leaves on the pine,
Yelling and crying, only in an unheard voice.

No, no place fore escape or hide
Iris perishing in the deepest of the mind
Galactic halos, spinning and speaking in front of the eyes-
Holding the cypress branches to fly to the edge of the sky,
To touch the moon, the stars before sunrise.
